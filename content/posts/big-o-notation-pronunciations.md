| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | "O one" or "constant time"                      |
| O(log n)   | "O log n" or "logarithmic time"                 |
| O(n)       | "O n" or "linear time"                          |
| O(n log n) | "O n log n" or "linearithmic time"              |
| O(n^2)     | "O n squared" or "quadratic time"               |
